      "Revolutionizing laundry services with AI-powered scheduling, stain recognition, and efficiency optimization",
    fullDescription: `
      Auro represents a revolutionary approach to laundry management, combining artificial intelligence with IoT technology to transform an everyday chore into an efficient, optimized experience. This comprehensive platform serves both commercial laundry operations and individual consumers with smart solutions that reduce resource consumption, extend equipment lifespan, and deliver superior cleaning results.

      The platform's core innovation lies in its advanced stain recognition system, which uses computer vision to identify and analyze stains, then recommend precise treatment protocols. This capability alone reduces rewash rates by up to 37% in commercial settings and helps consumers achieve professional-quality results at home.

      For consumers, the Auro mobile app provides a seamless interface to schedule laundry services, receive real-time updates, and access personalized care recommendations. The system learns from each interaction, continuously improving its recommendations based on user feedback and results.

      Agnes v.2.1 represents a paradigm shift in e-commerce, moving beyond passive recommendation systems to true agentic AI that acts autonomously on behalf of users. This revolutionary shopping assistant doesn't just suggest productsâ€”it actively manages the entire shopping journey with minimal human intervention.

      At its core, Agnes employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where specialized sub-agents collaborate to handle different aspects of the shopping process. The Research Agent identifies optimal products based on user needs, the Negotiation Agent finds the best prices, and the Budget Agent ensures all purchases align with financial constraints.

      Perhaps most impressively, Agnes can proactively identify needs based on usage patterns and seasonal changes, suggesting timely purchases before users even recognize the need themselves.
